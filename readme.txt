Blocks for Easy Digital Downloads and the new WordPress editor.

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads").

EDD Blocks adds a new "Downloads" block to the new WordPress editor, also known as Gutenberg (more blocks may be added in the future).

The Downloads block allows you to display a grid of Downloads on your site, similar to the [downloads] shortcode already provided by Easy Digital Downloads.
