Blocks for Easy Digital Downloads and the new WordPress editor.

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads").

EDD Blocks adds a "Downloads" block to the new WordPress editor, also known as Gutenberg.

The Downloads block allows you to display a grid of Downloads on your site similar to the [downloads] shortcode already provided by Easy Digital Downloads. The Downloads block provides a visual representation of your downloads, allowing you to see a real-time preview of your downloads as you configure the various settings.

As well as being able to display downloads, a grid of Download Categories or Download Tags can be shown.

Additional blocks may be created in a future version.
